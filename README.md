## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Rebuilding (Key Step)
Before building the dashboard, the dataset went through a complete **data cleaning and restructuring process**, including:

- Removing duplicates and invalid records  
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Standardizing city and governorate names  
- Creating derived columns (Price per Meter, Area in sqm, etc.)  
- Validating numerical fields (price, area, down payment)  
- Rebuilding the dataset into a **clean, analysis-ready model**

This step was crucial to ensure that all insights shown in the dashboard are trustworthy.
